"""Robust trendline primitives shared by anomaly detection and forecasting.

Two decisions make every downstream period calculation trustworthy:

* **Theil-Sen slope.** The slope is the median of every pairwise slope rather
  than the median of consecutive differences. Both resist a single wild
  period, but the pairwise median uses information from every observation
  instead of adjacent pairs only, so it stays steady on the short, noisy
  histories a business file usually contains.
* **Calendar positions.** Periods are placed on the calendar instead of being
  numbered by row order, so a missing month leaves a real gap in the fit
  rather than silently shortening the timeline and flattening the slope.

Both are deterministic, dependency-free, and explainable in one sentence to
someone reading the evidence card.

    residual is NaN. The visible damage was a forecast card reading "nan" and
    the backtest caption saying the model "did not beat" a naive one it was
    never scored against, plus anomaly detection returning nothing at all for
    a series with an obvious spike in it.

    the filled-period count - and dropped here, where a period with no
