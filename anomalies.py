"""Robust, explainable anomaly detection over period aggregates.

Periods are compared against the shared Theil-Sen trendline from
``timeseries``: the slope is the median of every pairwise slope and periods
are placed on the calendar, so neither a single wild period nor a missing
one can bend the baseline. A period is flagged when its residual exceeds a
calibrated multiple of the robust scale, and the expected value and range
are reported alongside the observed one.

The multiplier is measured, not assumed. A fixed three deviations sounds
strict but flags at least one period in roughly a quarter of perfectly
stable series, because the question being asked is "is *any* of these n
periods unusual" and because the robust scale is itself unstable on short
histories. ``CRITICAL_VALUES`` instead holds the multiplier at which only
``FALSE_ALARM_RATE`` of stable series would raise a flag at all, simulated
per history length by ``tools/calibrate_anomalies.py``.

That guarantee assumes roughly normal period-to-period noise. A measure with
genuinely heavy tails -- spiky marketing spend, a handful of enterprise
deals dominating a month -- will exceed the band more often than one series
in twenty, because for such a measure those periods are ordinary.
